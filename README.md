# DCIT318 Assignment 2 - OOP Concepts in C#

**Student ID:** 11046929

## Overview
This project demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in C# including inheritance, abstract classes, and interfaces.

## Features
The program provides an interactive menu to explore three key OOP concepts:

1. **Inheritance and Method Overriding**
   - Base `Animal` class with virtual `MakeSound()` method
   - Derived classes: `Dog` and `Cat` with overridden methods

2. **Abstract Classes and Methods**
   - Abstract `Shape` class with abstract `GetArea()` method
   - Concrete implementations: `Circle` and `Rectangle`
   - User input for calculating areas

3. **Interfaces**
   - `IMovable` interface with `Move()` method
   - Implementations: `Car` and `Bicycle` classes

## How to Run
1. Clone or download the project
2. Open terminal in the project directory
3. Run: `dotnet run`
4. Follow the interactive menu prompts

## Project Structure
- `Program.cs` - Main entry point with interactive menu
- `InheritanceExample.cs` - Demonstrates inheritance and method overriding
- `AbstractClassExample.cs` - Shows abstract classes and methods
- `InterfaceExample.cs` - Illustrates interface implementation

## Requirements
- .NET 8.0 or later
